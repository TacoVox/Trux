# Trux - Report
## Background
The goal for this project was to develop an android application that was targeted towards truck drivers with a main focus on driver safety. We had to integrate our application with an open source software named AGA ([Automotive Grade Android](https://developer.lindholmen.se/redmine/projects/aga/wiki/AGA_Project)) which is an interface for wheel based vehicles (e.g. a truck). AGA sends values for different signals from the vehicle, for example, speed and fuel consumption. We were also supposed to develop the application in Scrum with our supervisor and teachers as product owners.
